    "According to the economic innovation literature investors lack domain knowledge and therefore investors underreact to \"innovative knowledge,\" in the form of patents, patent applications, and patent citations. I posit that investors underreact to \"innovative knowledge\" regardless of the medium, be it patents, clinical trials, or scientific/technical newspaper articles. So, there could be a bunch scenarios in which extremely positive technical/scientific information is released to the public by a firm, but the market price for the firm lags behind the actual value. Or there could be situations in which there is a divergence between the sentiment in technical/scientific media releases and the news media coverage. To see this, consider the case  for company XXX, this company operates in an industry in which survival relies on being an innovative leader (pharmaceuticals, biotech, gene therapy etc.), and now suppose that the non-scientific new media coverage of company XXX holdings is positive, but the technical/scientific public releases tells a different story, further suppose that the stock price for company XXX seems to be following the non-scientific news coverage instead of the scientific. If this is the case than there is opportunity. For companies that depend on innovation traditional fundamental analysis may not be as important as the analysis of scientific/technical innovative releases. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the economic literature this type of information content is called \"innovative efficiency,\" and it is measured as a combination between patents/patent citations scaled by research and development expenditures. There are many papers that find strong evidence between innovative efficiency and future returns, but these papers do not use machine learning techniques, and they focus on causality rather than prediction. This project will focus on prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the experts who inform the sophisticated investor may be ill-informed since time and time again we have seen that experts underperform the machine: the wine taster can't tell the difference between Jersey wine and 1920s French Riesling, the portfolio manager underperforms the rules based consistent eft/mutual fund, the AI outperforming doctors in diagnosing cancer. What makes you think an expert can understand scientific jargon? Since technical writing is more structured than regular news media text this type of textual data may be easier to process. So, it seems promising that a ML algorithms can come to some robust predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this reasoning in hand, the primary purpose of this project will be to develop a trading strategy based on the information gleaned from scientific mediums. Specifically, I will focus my efforts on analyzing gene editing companies. I will apply deep learning and NLP techniques on the text of the patent applications, cluster news articles into scientific/non-scientific, and glean insights from these two different clusters.\n"

    "## Possible questions to answer\n",
    "If you follow NPR then you have heard about the gene editing technique called, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), but there are other techniques like Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), and Zinc-finger nuclease (ZFNs).  In fact, one company named Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) owns essentially all of the patents to ZFNs. So, one question I would like to answer is how does owning a select number of patents in a technology relate to a company’s future return? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also different types of gene therapy companies, for instance there are gene therapy companies focused more on neurological disorders, like Parkinson and Alzheimer’s disease, gene therapy companies focused on blood disorders, like Hemophilia, gene therapy companies focused on liver, retinal and hearing disorders. I would like employ classification models (K-nearest neighbors, Multiclass Linear Models, etc.) to cluster the space of gene-editing companies, and see if these clusters have meaningful interpretations.    \n",
    "\n",
    "A few months ago, I actually looked at patent application data. I wanted to see how many patent applications mentioned CRIPR; from May 2018 to Feb 2018 there where over 500 patent applications. These patents applications are all over the place and not solely relegated to biotech companies, for instance Microsoft had patent applications relating CRISPR to DNA storage, defense contractor Raytheon had patent applications relating CRISPR to layered circuits, and Monsanto had a surprising amount of patent applications relating CRISPR to crops. So, I would first like to know for which gene-editing technologies is the rate of patent application increasing? Second, for the technologies that have spillovers into other industries (e.g. `{\"CRISPR\": Tech, Defense, Agricultural, Gene-Therapy}`) does this spillover yield any profitable predictions? Last, for technologies in which the rate of patent applications is increasing and have a high amount of spillover, what does this mean for a firm to be a leader according to the \"innovative efficiency\" metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "The answers to these questions seem obvious, but we are talking about a disruptive and life-changing technology on the cusp of a breakout, and this harkens the case for investigation and profit.\n"

    "This project can be boiled down to making stock market predictions from scientific news releases that normal people have trouble understanding. Since I am focusing on biotech I may switch the focus of this project from making predictions based on patents to making predictions based on stage 1,2,3 clinical trials. "
